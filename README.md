## Data Structures
### Array
* An *array* is a collection with specified size
  * Dynamic array: some languages' implementations automatically expand as you add elements
* Access elements directly by index
* Time complexity:
  * Access by index: `O(1)`
  * Search by value: `O(n)`
  * Insert: `O(n)` (need to shift values)
  * Delete: `O(n)` (need to shift values)

### Linked List
* A *linked list* is a collection of nodes where each node has a value and a reference
* **Singly-linked list**: nodes have pointers to the next node
* **Doubly-linked list**: nodes have pointers to next and previous nodes
* Time complexity:
  * Access by index: `O(n)`
  * Search by value: `O(n)`
  * Insert: `O(1)`
  * Delete: `O(1)`

### Stacks & Queues
* **Stack**: last in, first out (LIFO)
  * Adding an element and popping the most recently added element are `O(1)` operations
* **Queue**: first in, first out (FIFO)
  * Adding an element and popping the oldest element are `O(1)` operations
* **Double-ended queue**: stack + queue combined
* `push` adds elements & `pop` extracts elements

### Trees
* A *tree* is an undirected, connected, acyclic graph
  * Has `v` vertices and `v-1` edges
  * Any two vertices are connected by a unique path
  * A **leaf** is a vertex of degree 1
  * One node is designated as the **root**
  * Each node has parent and/or children pointers
  * A node's height is the length of its path to the root
* A **forest** has multiple distinct trees (a disjoint union)
* An **n-ary tree** has at most `n` children per node

#### Binary Tree
* A *binary tree* has nodes with at most 2 children (designated left & right)
* **Full**: every node has 0 or 2 children
  * Number of nodes is at most `2^(h+1)-1`
* **Complete**: every level, except possibly the last, is filled, and the last level's nodes are as far left as possible
  * Number of internal nodes: `floor(n/2)`
* **Balanced**: has the minimum possible maximum depth
  * Height is `ceil(lg(n+1))`
* Traversals:
  * **Pre-order**: open current, visit left subtree, visit right subtree
  * **In-order**: visit left subtree, open current, visit right subtree (returns sorted list)
  * **Post-order**: visit left subtree, visit right subtree, open current
  * **Level-order**: breadth-first traversal, level by level

#### Binary Search Tree
* A *binary search tree* is an ordered binary tree
* Satisfies the BST property: each node's value is greater than all keys stored in the left subtree and less than all keys stored in the right subtree
* Designed to make searching faster--each comparison allows operations to skip about half the tree
* Search: recursively search subtrees; takes `O(h)`
* Insertion: like search, but insert node when a leaf is reached; takes `O(h)`
* Deletion: more complicated; takes `O(h)`
  * If deleting a node with no children, just do it
  * If deleting a node with a single child, replace the node with its subtree
  * If deleting a node with two children, swap with minimum value in right subtree or maximum value in left subtree, then delete the node (which should now be a leaf)

#### AVL Tree
* An *AVL tree* is a self-balancing binary search tree
* Pairs of subtrees differ in height by at most 1
* Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take `O(log n)`, since height is at most `O(log n)`
* Rotation balances the tree on update
* Implement by adding a **balance factor** on each node (difference between subtree heights)

#### Trie
* A *trie* is a special tree that stores subsequences of values, also known as a prefix tree
* Each node's descendants share a common prefix given by the node
* Useful for autocomplete

### Hashing
* A *hash function* is a function mapping an object to an integer such that if `a==b`, `H(a)==H(b)`
* **Universal hashing**: a randomized way of drawing a hash function from some set of functions so that performance is good in expectation
* **Perfect hashing**: has no collisions; usually only practical when the set of keys is roughly constant

#### Hash Tables
* A *hash table* is an array whose indices correspond to results from a hash function (implemented as a dictionary in Python)
* Provides `O(1)` lookup, assuming load factor is small enough
* **Load factor**: `n/k`, where `n` is number of entries and `k` is number of buckets
* Collision resolution
  * Chaining (e.g. with linked lists)
  * Open addressing (e.g. with linear probing, quadratic probing, or double hashing)
* **Table doubling**: choose a new hash function to map to the new size and insert elements from old table into new table
* **Simple uniform hashing assumption (SUHA)**: a hash function maps to any slot with equal probability

### Heap
* A *heap* is a special tree where nodes have higher (in the case of a min-heap) values than their parents
* Binary heap:
  * Heapify in `O(n)`
  * Find min in `O(1)`
  * Extract min, increase key, insert, delete in `O(log n)`
  * Can implement as a list where a node at index `i` has children at `2i` and `2i+1`

### Graph
* A *graph* is a collection of nodes and edges and can be directed or undirected
* **Cycle**: path that loops onto itself
* **Topological sort**: linear ordering of vertices such that directional constraints are preserved in a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
  * Generate using DFS by prepending to output list
* **Spanning tree**: a tree that includes all nodes in the graph
  * Minimum spanning tree: a spanning tree with minimum total edge weights
* **Complete graph**: fully connected; every pair of nodes has an edge
* **Bipartite graph**: split into two groups A and B where there are no edges within each groups
* **Clique**: a complete subgraph


## Algorithms
### Binary Search
* Given a sorted list, start at the midpoint and divide and conquer
* **Exponential search** is like binary search but in one direction (e.g. can be used in infinite sequence)
* `O(log n)`

### Sorting
#### Insertion
* Maintain a sorted sublist and insert new elements in it appropriately
* Sorts in-place; stable
* Best-case `O(n)`, average `O(n^2)`, worst `O(n^2)`

#### Bubble
* On each pass through the array, compare adjacent pairs of elements and swap if necessary
* Sorts in-place; stable
* Best-case `O(n)`, average `O(n^2)`, worst `O(n^2)`

#### Selection
* Exchange current element with smallest element to the right of the current element
* Sorts in-place; unstable
* Best-case `O(n^2)`, average `O(n^2)`, worst `O(n^2)`

#### Merge
* Recursively divide until sublists are size 1, then recursively merge the sublists
* Requires `O(n)` space; stable
* Best-case `O(n log n)`, average `O(n log n)`, worst `O(n log n)`

#### Quick
* Set some pivot element in the array; move elements smaller than pivot to its left and elements larger to the right
  * Recursively sort left and right sublists
* Requires `O(log n)` space; stable
* Best-case `O(n log n)`, average `O(n log n)`, worst `O(n^2)`

#### Counting/Bucket
* For lists whose elements' values are in a bounded, constant range
* Not a comparison sort so best & average is `O(n+k)` and worst is `O(n^2)` (not bounded to `O(n log n)`)
* Iterate through list and place items in buckets; can be stable

#### Radix
* Apply a stable counting sort to every place value in a number
* Sort places from least to most significant
* Requires `O(n+k)` space; `O(d(n+k))` time
* Also not a comparison sort

### Graph Search
* Given a graph, find a path from a start node to an end node
* General strategy: expand a node, check to see if it's the goal node, add its children to the *search agenda*
* In the case of weighted graphs, a **heuristic** may help find the shortest path faster
  * **Admissible**: heuristic's value for a node is less than actual distance from node to goal (`H(n,G) ≤ dist(n,G)` for all nodes `n`)
  * **Consistent**: heuristic follows triangle inequality (`|H(A)-H(B)| ≤ dist(A,B)` for all nodes `A,B`)

#### Depth-first
* Implement with a stack (add new paths to the front of the agenda)
* Can use for cycle detection

#### Breadth-first
* Implement with a queue (add new paths to the end of the agenda)
* In an unweighted graph, guaranteed to find shortest path

#### Hill-climbing
* Add new paths to the front of the agenda
* Sort *new* paths by terminal node's heuristic

#### Best-first
* Add new paths to the front of the agenda
* Sort *all paths* in agenda by terminal node's heuristic

#### Branch and bound
* Add new paths to the front of the agenda
* Sort agenda by path length so far
* Can also add a heuristic or extended set (or both)

#### A*
* Branch and bound with heuristic and extended set
* Heuristic must be consistent

#### Dijkstra's
* Find shortest path between two nodes (branch and bound with extended set and without heuristic)
* Can't handle negative edge weights
* Using a Fibonacci heap, runtime is `O(|E|+|V|log|V|)`

#### Bellman-Ford
* Compute shortest paths from a single source to all other nodes in the graph
* Can handle negative edge weights & detect negative-weight cycles
* Worst-case runtime is `O(|V||E|)`

#### Floyd-Warshall
* Dynamic programming all-pairs shortest paths algorithm
* `dp(i,j,k+1)=min(dp(i,j,k),dp(i,k+1,k)+dp(k+1,j,k))`

### Other Graph Algorithms
#### Min Cut & Max Flow
* The *min cut* problem asks for the minimum number of edges you can remove from a graph to disconnect a given source and sink
* The *max flow* problem asks for the maximum flow from a given source to sink
* **Karger's** randomized min-cut algorithm
* **Ford-Fulkerson** computes max flow
* Example of linear duality

#### Minimum Spanning Tree
* **Prim's** adds the smallest-weight connected edge that doesn't create a cycle
  * `O(|E|+|V|log|V|)` so use in dense graphs
* **Kruskal's** adds the globally smallest edge and keeps a forest (
  * `O(|E|log|V|)`

### Greedy Algorithms
* Locally optimal choices lead to globally optimal solution
* Be careful--this is usually rare!
* Prim's, Kruskal's, interval scheduling, Huffman codes, Dijkstra's

### Dynamic Programming
* A general method for solving a problem with optimal substructure by breaking it down into overlapping subproblems
* **Top-down**: memoize (store) solutions to subproblems and solve problem recursively
* **Bottom-up**: build up subproblems from base case up and avoid recursive overhead
  * Order subproblems by topologically sorting DAG of dependencies
* Knapsack problem, longest common subsequence, coin change, edit distance, minimum number of jumps, longest palindrome substring, balanced partition

## Other Concepts
### General
* Static/dynamic checking
* Strongly/weakly typed
* Compiled/interpreted
* Shallow/deep copying
* Immutable/mutable
* Defensive copying
* Pseudo-polynomial runtime

### Asymptotic Notation
* Look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Formal_definition) for formal definitions
* O - asymptotic upper bound
  * o - asymptotic upper bound, excluding same rate
* Ω - asymptotic lower bound
  * ω - asymptotic lower bound, excluding same rate
* Θ - same asymptotic growth
* Exponential > polynomial > logarithmic > constant
* Can ask for worst, best, or average case

### Object-oriented Programming
Inspiration from [here](https://quizlet.com/22436874/oop-vocabulary-object-oriented-programming-flash-cards/)
* *Abstract data type*: defined logically by set of values and set of operations
* *Class*: basic concept in OOP, bundles data type information with actions
* *Object*: runtime value which belongs to a class
* *Encapsulation*: information hiding to ensure data integrity
* *Hierarchy*: classes can have super- and subclasses
* *Inheritance*: a subclass inherits data and methods from its parent classes
* *Overriding*: a subclass inherits parent methods but may override them
* *Polymorphism*: different classes in a program can respond to the same message in different ways; useful when an object's class can't be determined at compile time
* *Identity*: checks whether two objects are the same location in memory
* *Equality*: checks whether two objects are behaviorally equivalent

### Concurrency
* Starting with a single-threaded program, threads can spawn new threads
* *Data races*: bugs in concurrent programs resulting from concurrent access to shared objects
* Ways to prevent data races: protect objects with locks so that only one thread can access an object at once, or use a special hyperobject

### Design Patterns
* *Model-view-controller*: model stores data, controller updates model, view generates user interface
* *Factory method*: use a factory object to create other objects rather than using a constructor
* *Singleton*: restrict instantiation of a class to a single object
* *Observer*: subjects notify observers of any state changes (usually by calling their methods); used in MVC
* Lots more

### The Internet

* GET: used to retrieve data, no other effect on the data
* POST: used to send data to the server (e.g. form)
* PUT: replaces current representation of resource (idempotent)
* DELETE: remove current representation resource

#### HTTP Status Codes
* 200 OK: success
* 400 Bad Request: syntax could not be understood
* 401 Unauthorized: request not fulfilled due to lack of authorization
* 403 Forbidden: request understood but not fulfilled, authorization will not help
* 404 Not Found: URI could not be matched
* 408 Request Timeout: server did not receive a timely response from client
* 418 I'm a teapot: the resulting entity body *may* be short and stout
* 500 Internal Server Error: server exception
* 503 Service Unavailable: server unable to handle the request (temporary)
* 504 Gateway Timeout: server did not receive a timely response from upstream server

#### Networking
* [OSI Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)

## Common Problems
Lots of these taken from [this blog](http://www.ardendertat.com/2012/01/09/programming-interview-questions/).
* **Fibonacci sequence**: print the `n`th Fibonacci number
  * Optimally, do this recursively and cache the subproblem solutions
* **Array pair sums**: given an array, output pairs which sum to a number `k`
  * Can do in `O(n)` with a set data structure. For each element in the array, check to see if `k-a[i]` is in the set, then add the element to a set.
* **Reverse a linked list**: reverse a singly linked list
  * Track previous and current nodes; iterate through list and swap the direction of pointers. Time is `O(n)` and space is `O(1)`.
* **Matrix region sum**: given multiple rectangular regions in a matrix, compute the sum of numbers in that region
  * Memoize sums of regions with the constraint that corners are at `m[0][0]`
* **Word permutation**: find all permutations of a word

      ```python
      def permute(word):
          if len(word) == 1:
              return {word}
          else:
              result = set()
              permutations = permute(word[:-1])
              letter = word[-1]
              for p in permutations:
                  result.update([p[0:i]+letter+p[i:] for i in range(0,len(word)+1)])
              return result
      ```

* **Median of number stream**: given a continuous stream of numbers, find the median of numbers so far at any time
  * Optimally, keep a max-heap of the smaller half of the numbers and a min-heap of the larger half of the numbers
* **Infinite array search**: given a sorted, infinite-length array, find a given value
  * Modify binary search to start at the array's first element and exponentially increase the index you search at. Time is `O(log n)`
* **Anagram pair**: determine if two words are anagrams
  * Comparison sort: sort the words in alphabetical order and check for equality. `O(n log n)`, where `n` is word length.
  * Count letters: use a hash table to track counts of letters in both words. `O(n)` runtime.
* **Anagram dictionary**: determine which words in a list are anagrams of a given word
  * Check for the membership of every permutation of the input word in the dictionary
* **Anagram list**: determine which sets of words in a dictionary are anagrams
  * Abstractly, hash each word and group by word. A hash can be a 26-digit string, or you can sort each word.
* **Binary search tree verification**: verify whether a tree satisfies the binary search tree property
  * For each node, track its possible minimum and maximum values
  * Performing an inorder traversal should produce a sorted list
* **Largest continuous sum**: in an array of integers, determine the subsequence with the largest sum
  * Track maximum sum encountered so far and check whether current sum is greater. Reset current sum when it becomes negative. Time is `O(n)` and space is `O(1)`.
* **-1/0/1 array**: given an array where values are -1, 0, or 1, sort the array
  * Bucket sort (but this takes `O(n)` space)
  * Iterate through the list and track pointers for min and max index. If a value is -1, swap it with the element at the min index and increment min index. If a value is 1, swap it with the element at max index and decrement max index. Time is `O(n)` and space is `O(1)`.
* **k-th largest element**: find the `k`th largest element in an unsorted array
  * Modify quicksort to recursively sort on pivots in left/right subarrays (average `O(n)`, worst-case `O(n^2)`)
  * Median of medians algorithm
* **Find missing number**: given an array where every number except one appears an even number of times, find the number that appears an odd number of times
  * Optimally, bitwise XOR by numbers in the list (XORing an even number of times resets the number to its original value). Time is `O(n)` and space is `O(1)`
* **Knapsack**: given a set of items each with weights and values, maximize value while keeping total weight under a limit
  * Dynamic programming: say weight limit is `W`. Create an array `m[w]` where each element is the maximum value of items with a weight limit `w≤W`. Optimize by dividing item weights and weight limit by their greatest common divisor. Runtime `O(nW)`.
* **Balanced partition**: given a set of numbers, partition them so that the sums of the partitions are as close as possible
  * Greedy method: iterate through sorted list and add items to the smaller-sum partition
  * Dynamic programming: determine if a subset of the input sums to `n/2` (where `n` is the sum of the input numbers)
* **LRU Cache**: implement a least-recently used cache
  * Use two data structures: queue (implemented using doubly linked list) and hash table. Queue contains pages in access order & hash map maps pages to queue node

## Java Cheatsheet
### Program structure
```Java
public class Program {
  // main
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Hello h = new Hello("hi");
    System.out.println(h);
  }
}
```
```Java
public class Hello {
  private String text; // private instance variable

### Data Types
* Primitive: `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`, `byte`, `short`, `long`, `float`
* Also `Integer`, `Double`, `String` classes
  * Note that `char` literals have single quotes and `String` literals have double quotes
* Arrays: use `[]` after type name (fixed length, `length` variable)
* Interfaces -> concrete classes:
  * `List` -> `ArrayList`, `LinkedList` (variable length, `size()` method, can't store primitives)
  * `Set` -> `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, `TreeSet`
  * `Map` -> `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, `TreeMap`
* `Collection` parent interface of `Set`, `List`, `Queue`, `Deque`
* Others: `File`, `Math`, `Scanner`, `StringTokenizer`
* `Object` class at the top of the hierarchy

## Programming Languages
* Low level vs high level
* Compiled vs interpreted
* Imperative vs declarative (and functional)
* Statically typed vs dynamically typed
* See [Comparison of programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages)

### A Tiny Bit of C
```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```

### A Tiny Bit of C++
```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Hello {
    std::string name;
  public:
    Hello (std::string newName) { name = newName; }
    std::string hello () { return "Hello " + name; }
};

int main () {
  Hello h ("world");
  cout << h.hello();
  return 0;
}
```

### A Tiny Bit of Ruby
```Ruby
class HelloWorld
   def initialize(name)
      @name = name
   end
   def hello
      puts "Hello #{@name}!"
   end
end

h = HelloWorld.new("World")
h.hello
```

### A Tiny Bit of Go
```Go
package main
import "fmt"

type hello struct {
    name string
}
func (h hello) hello() string {
    return "hello " + h.name
}

func main() {
    h := hello{name: "world"}
    fmt.Println(h.hello())
}
```

## Problem-solving Strategies
General categories of problems
* Straight-forward instruction following
* String manipulation
* Tree traversal
* Graph search
* Dynamic programming

Approaching coding interview questions
* Be thorough and verbalize your thought process (esp. if you're stuck!)
* First, clarify the question and any assumptions you're making about input/output/behavior
* Walk through potential solutions (if you can think of multiple with different runtime/space requirements, explain the tradeoffs and pick the one you'll implement)
* Write out the function header & return value type
* Implement the function body, explaining your code as you go & mentioning any invariants
* When you're done, say so and walk through simple examples
* Write out some test cases, esp edge cases
* Talk about the runtime and space requirements of your solution
